      "Jimmy Prout, 45, was subjected to months of \"Dark Ages\" abuse by a group he thought were his friends, the jury at Newcastle Crown Court was told. Ann Corbett, 26, Zahid Zaman, 43, Myra Wood, 50, and Kay Rayworth, 56, of North Shields, deny murder and allowing the death of a vulnerable adult. The four pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. The jury heard the group had a strange relationship with Mr Prout that developed an almost \"cultish dimension\". However, it is alleged a series of events in late 2015 created tensions which led to serious assaults against the father-of-two, including knocking out his teeth. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said: \"Over a period of time, Jimmy Prout was not just mistreated, he was tortured. \"The defendants took part in that violence either inflicting injuries directly or assisting or encouraging the other members of the group to do so.\" Mr Greaney said the evidence suggested Mr Prout died on 9 February 2016, and that his body was dumped on wasteland 100 metres from his home where it began to decompose and was partly eaten by animals. The group then allegedly tried to cover\n",

      "Media playback is not supported on this device World number 216 Ward - who had radically defied expectations in reaching the semis - started nervously as the Frenchman broke with ease. Though Ward found a groove to break in the second set, Tsonga clawed it back. He then edged the tie-break 9-7 as Ward failed to convert a set point. Media playback is not supported on this device The smooth-serving 24-year-old Londoner, determined throughout despite playing four demanding sets of tennis within the previous 24 hours, earned the chance to level with a superb volleyed return. But Tsonga saved it with nerveless second serve in a match when Ward's position outside the elite was finally exposed, but only just, against a player of real class. Though Ward misses out on a dream all-British final, it is likely his world ranking will rise to around the 176 mark. \"It's obviously been a fantastic week for me - my best so far,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I just hope to build on it from here on in.
