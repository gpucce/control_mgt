      "Media playback is not supported on this device World number 216 Ward - who had radically defied expectations in reaching the semis - started nervously as the Frenchman broke with ease. Though Ward found a groove to break in the second set, Tsonga clawed it back. He then edged the tie-break 9-7 as Ward failed to convert a set point. Media playback is not supported on this device The smooth-serving 24-year-old Londoner, determined throughout despite playing four demanding sets of tennis within the previous 24 hours, earned the chance to level with a superb volleyed return. But Tsonga saved it with nerveless second serve in a match when Ward's position outside the elite was finally exposed, but only just, against a player of real class. Though Ward misses out on a dream all-British final, it is likely his world ranking will rise to around the 176 mark. \"It's obviously been a fantastic week for me - my best so far,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I just hope to build on it from here on in.

      "As the highly anticipated 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil draws near, BBC Sport's renowned football pundit, Mark Lawrenson, has made his predictions for the opening games of the tournament. The former Liverpool and England defender has been a stalwart in the world of football punditry, and his predictions are always eagerly anticipated by fans and neutrals alike. Lawrenson has been tasked with predicting the outcomes of the opening matches in each group, and his first set of predictions are as follows: Group A: Brazil vs. Croatia Lawrenson has predicted a 2-0 win for Brazil, citing the home advantage and the quality of the Brazilian squad. He believes that the likes of Neymar and Oscar will be too much for the Croatian side to handle, and that the hosts will make a statement in their opening match. Group A: Mexico vs. Cameroon In this match, Lawrenson has predicted a 2-1 win for Mexico. He believes that the Mexican side has a strong squad, with players like Javier Hernandez and Andres Guardado, and that they will be too strong for the Cameroonian side. He also thinks that Cameroon's lack of experience at this level will count against them. Group B: Spain vs. Netherlands Lawrenson\n"
