This is avoided when using Sobolev gradients, rendering the segmentation problem less ill-posed. The high computational cost and implementation overhead of Sobolev gradients, however, have hampered practical applications. We show how particle methods as applied to image segmentation allow for a simple and computationally efficient implementation of Sobolev gradients. We show that the evaluation of Sobolev gradients amounts to particle-particle interactions along the contour in an image. We extend an existing particle-based segmentation algorithm to using Sobolev gradients.

The present particle approximation of Sobolev gradients is 2.8 to 10 times faster than the previous reference implementation, but retains the known favorable properties of Sobolev gradients. This speedup is achieved by using local particle-particle interactions instead of solving a global Poisson equation at each iteration.

Our results indicate that both weight transfer and layer transfer play a crucial role in facilitating knowledge transfer, but their contributions to the transferred knowledge are qualitatively different. Weight transfer captures the fine-grained knowledge learned from the source task, such as task-specific patterns and feature correlations, whereas layer transfer captures the more general knowledge contained in the representation learned from the data, including relationships between features and semantic representations.

This requires the high-level semantic features should be as much alike as possible among samples. To achive this, previous works focus on re-designing the loss or proposing new regularization constraints. In this paper, we provide a new perspective. For each category, it is assumed that there are two feature sets: one with reliable information and the other with less reliable source. We argue that the reliable set could guide the feature learning of the less reliable set during training - in spirit of student mimicking teacher behavior and thus pushing towards a more compact class centroid in the feature space. Such a scheme also benefits the reliable set since samples become closer within the same category - implying that it is easier for the classifier to identify. We refer to this mutual learning process as feature intertwiner and embed it into object detection. It is well-known that objects of low resolution are more difficult to detect due to the loss of detailed information during network forward pass (e.g., RoI operation). We thus regard objects of high resolution as the reliable set and objects of low resolution as the less reliable set. Specifically, an intertwiner is designed to minimize the distribution divergence between two sets. The choice of generating an effective feature representation for the reliable set is further investigated, where we introduce the optimal transport (OT) theory into the framework.

By revisiting the principle of camera exposure, dynamic blur can be described by the relative motions of sharp content with respect to each exposed pixel. We define exposure trajectories, which record the trajectories of relative motions to represent the motion information contained in a blurry image and explain the causes of the dynamic blur. A new blur representation, which we call motion offset, is proposed to model pixel-wise displacements of the latent sharp image at multiple timepoints. Under mild constraints, the learned motion offsets can recover dense, (non-)linear exposure trajectories, which significantly reduce temporal disorder and ill-posed problems.

Firstly, the learned features are disentangled into common parts and specific parts. The common parts represent the transferrable features, which are suitable for domain adaptation with less negative transfer. Conversely, the specific parts characterize the unique style of each individual domain.

In this paper, we investigate the theoretical limits of end-to-end learning, particularly focusing on its capability to tackle tasks that require coordination and communication between components with incompatible or non-hierarchical decision-making logic. Our work explores the fundamental limits of end-to-end optimization, leveraging methods from statistical learning theory to analyze the gradient-based optimization algorithms used to train the constituent components. We derive upper bounds on the performance of end-to-end optimization as a function of the task difficulty, component complexity, and communication opportunities between components.

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a powerful framework for modeling real-world decision-making problems where the agent's current state is not observable directly, but rather through noisy or incomplete observations.

Recently, undercomplete POMDPs, where the state space is partially observed but the unobserved part is assumed to follow a known prior distribution, have emerged as a promising intermediate model class between fully observable and fully partially-observable environments. In undercomplete POMDPs, while the observed information is limited, the complete state distribution is partially known, offering a middle ground where standard reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can be applied but with tractable computational costs.
