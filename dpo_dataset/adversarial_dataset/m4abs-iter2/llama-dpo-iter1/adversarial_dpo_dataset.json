The fidelity of the synthetic image is further refined by integrating a perceptual quality estimation model, trained with face images rendered using multiple synthesis methods and their crowd-sourced naturalness ratings, into the LEGAN framework as an auxiliary discriminator. Using objective metrics like FID and LPIPS, LEGAN is shown to generate higher quality face images when compared with popular GAN models like StarGAN and StarGAN-v2 for lighting and expression synthesis.

In the second stage, an attention-based autoencoder uses the refined spatial properties generated by the first stage to correlate visual and audio inputs. Testing on various public datasets demonstrates significant advancements over existing methods, with notable improvements in perceived image-quality. We also provide means to mitigate such systems' propensity for mode collapse and improve temporal consistency in the generated visuals.

An auxiliary action discriminator network, trained with the same weights, distinguishes between semantic segmentations and random labels. The performance of ACCL is evaluated on four publicly available benchmarks and our experimental results show significant improvements over the modified loss functions and an elevation gain in accuracy for DICE score(+) 10% when compared to unmodified cross-entropy loss function. Our results demonstrate that ACCL is a robust and powerful tool for weakly supervised biomedical image segmentation.

However, in reality, people make many important decisions under uncertainty. To better understand preference learning in these cases, we study the setting of inverse decision theory (IDT), a previously proposed framework where a human is observed making non-sequential binary decisions under uncertainty. In IDT, the human's preferences are conveyed through their loss function, which expresses a tradeoff between different types of mistakes. We give the first statistical analysis of IDT, providing conditions necessary to identify these preferences and characterizing the sample complexity -- the number of decisions that must be observed to learn the tradeoff the human is making to a desired precision. Interestingly, we show that it is actually easier to identify preferences when the decision problem is more uncertain. Furthermore, uncertain decision problems allow us to relax the unrealistic assumption that the human is an optimal decision maker but still identify their exact preferences; we give sample complexities in this suboptimal case as well.

We develop an inverse theory that maps observed human behavior to a set of latent preferences, assuming that the uncertainty about preferences is caused by the inability to compare different options directly. We propose a probabilistic model for representing preferences and a factorization to approximate human decision-making behavior under uncertainty. The approach is then used to analyze human behavior in two real-world scenarios: a laboratory decision task and a real-world consumer choice experiment. Our framework accommodates for unique human behavior present in both tasks, allowing our model to adapt to the uncertainties present in these situations. Additionally, we found that our framework better performs when compared to a simple prospect theory-like model that assumes well-defined preferences - a common assumption in decision theory.
